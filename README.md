Portfolio projects

1. Analysis of CSV data for cycling 
2. Analysis of COVID-19 data(Live project)
3. Predicting Genre of Book from Summaries



### 1. Analysis of CSV data for cycling
* Data was cleaned and checked thoroughly 
* Corrected the timezone for a dataset
* Merged datasets using inner join.
* Removed rides with no measured power
* Checked the distribution of key variables
* Explored relationships between variables
* Verified that races are harder than rides in general
* Summarizes distance, TSS and average speed by month
* Found relation between monthly distance travelled and TSS
* Predicted TSS based on distance

Project Title : DR.STEVE CYCLING ROUTINE ANALYSIS
Getting Started
To get started with this project you need jupyter installed https://jupyter.org/install . Initiate with cloning the repository in your machine using command prompt. after cloning you need to check wheather you have two dataset required. you can check them under data folder.

Thanks to all the teachers for their valuable feedback.


### 2. Analysis of COVID-19 data
* Grouped the data by country
* Removed unnecessary columns
* Plottted the graph of number of cases in some countries
* Converted the graph of number of cases to logrithmic form
* Normalized number of cases by population
* Vizualized decrease in growth due to measures taken by China

Project Title : Analysing COVID-19 DATA ( ON A LIVE DATASET) 
Getting Started
To get started with this project you need jupyter installed https://jupyter.org/install . Initiate with cloning the repository in your machine using command prompt. after cloning you need to check wheather you have two dataset required.
